Understand how socioeconomic variables impacts the demand side of the energy supply/demand equilibrium.\n    2. Apply our knowledge in the form of a social program\n\nMicrosimulation\n========================================================\nWhat is it?\n- Computerized analytical tools used to evaluate the effects of proposed interventions\n      - Compares baseline/reference and several alternate scenarios\n\nExamples:\n- A traffic model evaluated the effectiveness of lengthening a turn lane\n- The Federal Reserve uses the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) method to regulate how banks invest under different economic scenarios (i.e. stress tests)\n- Our model evaluates a social program's impact on the economy\n\nMicrosimulation and Social Programs\n========================================================\nThis project:\n- Looks at how a social program that provides a cash transfer impacts energy consumption across different economic classes and economic scenarios\n      - Randomly-sampled households were surveyed\n      - Household income, socioeconomicdemographics, measured energy consumption\n      - Actual data from Mauritius, Mexico, and Bolivia*\n\nMicrosimulation Methodology\n========================================================\n1. Data Collection\n2. Data Cleaning and Recoding\n3. Econometric Modelling: How income and sociodemographics impacts energy consumption\n4. Coefficient Estimation: How the sample is generalizable to the general population\n5. Creating Set of Policies: Cash Transfer\n6. Define Target Population(s): Economic Classes\n7. Microsimulation Results\n\nMethods\n========================================================\nclass: large-code\nEconometric Model:\n$$latex\nln(Y_i) = \\alpha_i + \\beta_i ln(X_i) + {\\delta_i}*{W_i} + \\epsilon_i\n$$\n- $Y_i$: energy consumption/demand\n- $\\alpha_i$: constant related to each household\n- $\\beta_i$: elasticity income-energy consumption/demand coefficient\n- $ln(X_i)$: log of income\n- $\\delta_i$: coefficient associated to household variables, like sex, age, number of individuals, geographic area\n- $W_i$: household variables\n- $\\epsilon_i$: measurement error\n\nScenarios & Economic Policies\n========================================================\n|       Scenarios           | Description              | GDP Growth Rate |\n|--------------------------:|:-------------------------|-----------------|\n|  Base                     | Income growth rate of 3% |  3.0%           | \n|  Pro-poor                 | Bottom 50% received ~6.9 dollars to match the mean energy consumption                    |  3.0%           | \n|  Pro-poor & Middle-Class  | In addition to pro-poor policy, the middle-class (51-90%) received ~3.95 dollars (half of the energy consumption cost)              |  3.0%           |\n\nResults\n========================================================\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\na=c(\"Base\", \"Pro-Poor\", \"Pro-Poor & Middle-Class\")\nb=c(\"160953.7[2020]-160953.7[2030]\", \"152602.5[2020]-170139.5[2030]\", \"179526.6[2020]-198259.3[2030]\")\nc=c(\"321907.3[2020]-362552[2030]\", \"305205[2020]-340278.9[2030]\", \"359053.2[2020]-396518.6[2030]\")\nd=c(\"69542341[2020]-78304773[2030]\", \"68359574[2020]-76459208[2030]\", \"75540896[2020]-83756012[2030]\")\ndf_presentation <- data.frame(a,b,c,d)\ncolnames(df_presentation) <- c(\"Scenarios\", \"Electricity Demand (KW) for Bottom 25%\", \"Electricity Demand (KW) for Bottom 50%\", \"Total Weighted Electricity Demand (KW) within population\")\nknitr::kable(df_presentation)\n```\nResults of Scenarios & Economic Policies (Graphs)\n========================================================\n![Mainplot](presentation_mainplot.png)\n***\n![Subplots](TestPlot.png)\n\nSummary\n========================================================\n- Marginal Effect between a shock in income and electricity demand.\n- Bottom households with lowest income more elastic to shock in income compared to rest of population. Pro-poor policies were effective.\n- Conclusion: Social programs can have a crucial, positive impact on electricity demand and on the economy.\n\n========================================================\n<center> <h1>Thank You</h1> </center>",
